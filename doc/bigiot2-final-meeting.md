### Park My Car

PICTURE: Cologne
PICTURE: Full parking house
PICTURE: sign with parkmycar.app

You arrived in a city. Want to park the car.

I google 'parking Berlin' -> 'Park My Car'
OR see a 'ParkMyCar.app' URL on a full parking house

Zero install. Zero registration.
1. allow location, 2. select parking site 

Uses Google Maps native app for direction on mobile. Android/iOS.
Falls back to browser.

Add to homescreen like a native app.
For next time.
